## Info

This mod covers the barren grass surface of Timber Hearth with trees and grass.

The trees do not have hitboxes to make landing and flying easier (you can imagine how difficult it would be to land on the planet if they did!).

## Usage

The denisty of grass an trees can be set in the mod settings menu between either ultra, high, medium, low or hidden depending on your preference. Grass and tree density can also be set seperately.

## Known Issues

Grass has a small chance of not spawning, don't worry, next game loop it will be there again - working on finding the cause of this!
